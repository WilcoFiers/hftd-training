  Welcome to practice <server> two!
  The text you are reading currently is the publicly available text this server gives users that <ping> it.

  This server is designed to guide the user into teaching the basics of <Quantum Hacking>.
  It is designed to be hacked by 1 hacker, but can be tackled by a team if you prefer to learn together.

  After reading these pages you should type `~initiate server scan` to start the hack.

  This will initiate a scan of the server so you know what access ports the server has and what <actions> can be taken on those <ports>.

  Be careful though! as soon as you initiate the server scan, the system will try and <trace> you.

  Scan Result:

  Port 1:
  - Initial connect
  - Connect to port 2
  - Upload data
  - Download data
  - Edit data

  Port 2
  - Connect to port 1
  - Brute force security system 1, 3 damage, costs 0 QPU
  - Upload data
  - Download data
  - Edit data

  And after a few seconds the computer will blurt warnings to you. Stuff like:

  ### THREAT DETECTED ###
  At the start of tick 1, security system 1 starts to track you and needs 6 damage to be brute forced.
  After 5 ticks you will be traced.

  And

  ### THREAT DETECTED ###
  At the start of tick 3, Port 1 creates a security log. Edit it's data to edit all your activities out.
  After 6 ticks you will be traced, even if all AIâ€™s are disconnected.

  Now it is your turn to type commands in 10 minutes. You can type command like this:

  T0: Initial connect <- This is always the first command you do, it connects you to one of the ports
  T1: Connect to port 2 <- This connects you to port 2, where there are more commands available to you.
  T2: Brute force <- This brute forces the security system doing it 3 damage.
  T3: Brute force <- This does the security system another 3 damage, which is enough to crack it! In time for the 5 turn deadline.
  T4: Download data <- This downloads any data on port 2. Your AI will send this data to you if the hack is successful
  T5: Connect to port 1 <- You need to connect to port 1 to perform actions there
  T6: Edit data <- This erases anything you did from the log, stopping people from tracing your AI afterwards.
  T7: <- You can leave these empty for now, as we don't need the last three commands. You don't even need to type them.
  T8:
  T9:
  T10: Disconnect <- This is always the command given at T10. You don't even need to type it. Your quantum program will automatically disconnect after 11 ticks.
