    name: "Standard Tracing and Kicker Program"
    description: |
      At the start of T02, Security System 3 starts tracing you.
      It needs 4 damage to be brute forced. It ignores the first 2 damage per tick.
      If attacks from this program reduce nodes in a trace route to 4 or less nodes, all QAIs at port 4 are immediately disconnected.

      - At the end of T03 trace route 3 will lose 1 node(s).
      - At the end of T04 trace route 3 will lose 2 node(s).
      - At the end of T05 trace route 3 will lose 3 node(s).
