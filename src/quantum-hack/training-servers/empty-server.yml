name: "loading..." # The name of your server
duration: "10:00" # How long a scan lasts on this server. Format is "mm:ss". Defaults
          # to 10:00 minutes.

# The following messages are sent at various times while the server is active.
# Since these text can get long, they may trigger the Discord maximum character
# limit for messages, which is 2000 characters. To avoid this, split your
# message in several parts as an array. Each part of the message will be sent
# separately.
#
# For example:
#
# welcome_message: "A welcome message. A second line."
#
# Can also be written as:
#
# welcome_message:
# - "A welcome message."
# - "A second line."
#
# The second form will be sent as two separate messages.

welcome_message: # A welcome message to send on server start.

scan_result: # A message that will be sent as scan result.

planning_done: # A message that will be sent when all members have entered a plan.

finished_success: # A message that will be sent when everyone has run their plan
                  # before time runs out.

finished_timeout: # A message that will be sent when the time is up.

# Threat definitions.
#
# Each threat consists of a time when this threat appears, a description of the
# threat, a type of the threat and optionall a health of the threat.
#
# Threats is expected to be a list of threat definitions.
threats:
-   time: # The time when this threat appears. Format is "mm:ss".
    description: # A description of this threat that is shown to players.
    type: # The type of threat. Currently a freeform string that is unused.
    health: # The health of the threat. Currently unused.

# Something like this will be added later:
#
# ports:
# - id: "1"
#   description: "Description"
#   actions:
#   -   name: "Action Name"
#       type: "action type"
#       arguments:
#       - "argument 1"
#       - "argument 2"
